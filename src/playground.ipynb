      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "### What's the goal of modular software design?\n",
      "\n",
      "Modular software design is all about dividing functionalities into independent pieces - modules. Those modules should be easy to understand, test, modify, change, replace, or delete in isolation without making a big impact on the rest of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What is a module?\n",
      "\n",
      "The word \"module\" can mean multiple things. In this article, I always use it in the context of modular design. A module is a piece of grouped functionality exposing an interface, by which other modules can communicate with it. You can also see it described as a component or a (bounded) context in other sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Do you need it?\n",
      "\n",
      "***** 7 *****\n",
      "{'source': 'https://tech.appunite.com/blog/modular-software-design-mistakes', 'lastmod': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 28, 7, 33, 51, 264000), 'start_index': 946}\n",
      "### Do you need it?\n",
      "\n",
      "The mistakes listed here are not hard rules. Each design decision you make should be driven by the functional and non-functional requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bicycle may be your default way of moving around. And while it's a perfect choice for you moving around town, it would be a mistake to take in on a highway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context is everything. For every rule, for every pattern, always ask: How does this fit my context?\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of modular design might not be a priority for you. But if they are, here are 10 common mistakes you may want to think about.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Using database tables from other modules\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing and reading directly from the DB tables owned by other modules makes those modules harder to change (see also: Integration Database).\n",
      "\n",
      "***** 8 *****\n",
      "{'source': 'https://tech.appunite.com/blog/modular-software-design-mistakes', 'lastmod': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 28, 7, 33, 51, 264000), 'start_index': 1702}\n",
      "Shared DB tables often end up too complicated because they try to serve the needs of multiple modules. Paraphrasing SRP, we can say that each DB table should have exactly one reason to change. When we share a table between multiple modules, we violate that.\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid that, each module should own its storage and properly encapsulate it. A single table used by multiple modules should probably be split into a few separate tables, each suited for a specific need.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Requiring strong consistency, using DB transactions across modules\n",
      "\n",
      "It's tempting to use DB transactions to ensure data consistency between different modules. But transactions come at a cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, they force you to use a single database. If you ever need to change a storage method used in some module, this is a big challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "***** 9 *****\n",
      "{'source': 'https://tech.appunite.com/blog/modular-software-design-mistakes', 'lastmod': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 28, 7, 33, 51, 264000), 'start_index': 2512}\n",
      "Secondly, it can negatively affect the user experience, since transactions affect how the system fails. Many actions from the user require us to synchronize multiple modules. But that shouldn't affect the end-user. A classic example - would you like to prevent the user from placing an order only because of a temporary bug in a module responsible for the delivery?All-or-nothing behaviour is not always desirable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transactions are often a sign of too much coupling between modules. So use transactions carefully. Using transactions should be a conscious decision made after evaluating different options.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Always using foreign key constraints across modules\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign key constraints seem to have no downside. Inconsistent data is a big problem, so who'd like to risk it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign key constraints create a really strong coupling between two parts of the system. Sometimes it's a must-have. But it also hurts our ability to replace components as the system evolves.\n",
      "\n",
      "***** 10 *****\n",
      "{'source': 'https://tech.appunite.com/blog/modular-software-design-mistakes', 'lastmod': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 28, 7, 33, 51, 264000), 'start_index': 3484}\n",
      "Foreign key constraints also suffer from similar issues as DB transactions. Once requirements force you to drop them, you'll need to put a lot of effort to deal with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it more important to always maintain data integrity, or to be elastic? The answer can be different for every system and every piece of data in a single system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the rate of changes, the risk and the consequences of inconsistent data, and business context. Integrity between transactions and accounts is a must-have. Integrity between a user and the list of recently-used emojis? Probably not.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Not testing in isolation\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing (especially TDD) is one of the best and fastest ways to get feedback about your design.\n",

      "Testing (especially TDD) is one of the best and fastest ways to get feedback about your design.\n",
      "\n",
      "A well-designed interface allows you to use the module easily. Low coupling allows you to skip big setup blocks before your tests. Good encapsulation means that you don’t need to test the internal state and modify the tests with each refactor. With good boundaries between the domain and infrastructure code, you don’t need to use mocking so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good modular code should make each module easy to test. If you cannot easily test your module in isolation, this probably means that the boundaries could be improved. And if you don’t try to test in isolation, you miss that important feedback from your tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Circular dependencies between modules\n",
      "\n",
      "If module A knows about module B and module B knows about module A, it's a clear sign of troubles. Either the modules are too coupled (maybe they should be merged into one module?), or there's a third module waiting to be extracted.\n",
      "\n",

      "{'source': 'https://tech.appunite.com/blog/modular-software-design-mistakes', 'lastmod': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 28, 7, 33, 51, 264000), 'start_index': 5080}\n",
      "## 6. Too small modules\n",
      "\n",
      "When we start fighting with a big ball of mud, we overcompensate. We want to run away from big modules and we end up with modules that are way too small.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not the size of a module that matters, though. It's the complexity and coupling. Most problems come from either:\n",
      "\n",
      "- modules doing too much to understand them easily (too complex)\n",
      "- modules that don't do anything interesting on their own and need to collaborate with other modules extensively to accomplish something (too much coupling)\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of worrying about size, think about coupling, coherency and good encapsulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. \"Dumb\", entity-based modules & poor encapsulation\n",
      "\n",
      "The job of our software is to do something. If you organize your modules around the entities, you will probably need to synchronize multiple of them to accomplish any business action.\n",

      "The easiest way to avoid this is to think about the behavior of the module. What does it do? Once you know the behavior, only then think about the necessary data. Then make sure that the data is encapsulated behind a clean and deep interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following Tell, Don't Ask principle can also help you to avoid this problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 8. 1-1 correspondence between controller actions and business functions\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting business logic in the web controller is a common issue. So one of the first changes we do is to move all the code out of the controllers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controllers should not just be a pass-through layer, though. They shouldn't contain business logic, but it doesn't mean that there should not be any code in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controllers (and the web layer in general) have a role - they communicate between the domain layer and the rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "***** 14 *****\n",

      "There’s nothing wrong with calling 2 or more functions in the web controller if you need to pre-process the parameters or fetch more data to render. There’s nothing wrong with doing two query calls instead of using a join. Application-level joins have a bad reputation, but they can be a useful tool for achieving better modularity (especially when gradually refactoring an old codebase).\n",
      "\n",
      "Changing the response format shouldn’t affect the domain code (and its tests) just as changing the way you store data shouldn’t affect the web layer. Doing the translation from the domain concept to the web concepts (and vice versa) at the controller level creates a boundary that ensures that you can modify each of the layers in isolation.\n",

      "\n",
      "The question to ask yourself: will the duplicated parts always change at the same time? If the answer is yes, code reuse might be a good idea. But if the code is only the same at the current time, there's nothing wrong with using the same code in two places. DRY was never about mechanical code duplication, so don't be afraid of the good old copy-paste sometime.\n",

      "Modular design is all about being able to make changes in software easily, within a well-defined boundary. But if the boundaries of the modules you create are misaligned with the natural boundaries of your problem domain, making changes can still be hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategic Domain Driven Design is a great way to prevent that. No amount of technical patterns, architecture choice, or refactoring can replace good domain knowledge.\n",

      "If you follow the language and those natural boundaries, the code will easily fall in the right places. The changes you make will likely fit inside those boundaries as well, which is the ultimate goal of modular software design.\n",

But everyone should and let this trivia be a wake-up call: in the first half of 2021, over 813 000 of apps were deleted from the Google Play the iOS Store (Pixalate report, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "And why is that? Mostly because they didn’t comply with policy and privacy changes but also design and functionality requirements. And how to make sure that your app fulfills them? Mainly by maintenance, of course.\n",

      "For the last year, I've been thinking a lot about a path which would allow me to be a true professional. I've learned new types of architecture, patterns, ways to improve the design of my code. It has helped me a lot to grow as an iOS developer, to deliver faster. But when it comes to being a professional, it's not only about your coding skills. It's about mastering the development process. Typically you've got a task, then you start coding and after it's done - push it to production. It's quite a simple flow, isn't it?\n",

      "Let's assume that your task is to shop for the ingredients to make pizza. You know the recipe, you know which ingredients you need to make pizza - does it mean that you are ready? You might be, but you might end up having a problem putting all the ingredients into your fridge, because it contains too many objects that you have implemented bought before.\n",

      "It is called ingredients duplication\n",
      "\n",
      "As silly as this example may seem, it shows that before you start even an easy task, you should get to know what you need to do. If your task is too big, ask your teammates whether anything in the project can be used. If you are the only developer in the project - spend some time on research. It might save your time and protect you against code duplication.\n",

      "Do you go to the same shop as always? Maybe there is something that could be improved in your recipe? Here is the area for your growth. If you spend a few minutes on searching for a shop with a better quality of ingredients, you will have a higher chance to bake better pizza! Same with your task. It's worth spending some more time to make sure that the solution you are proposing is the best. Read articles, talk with your colleagues, write down a draft of a solution, ask for feedback. If there is some legacy code which you would need to interact with, maybe it is a good time to refactor it? Just keep it reasonable - if your task would take a few hours, it's not a good idea to do it for tens of hours.\n",

It would help you to quickly determine what has already been done and what should be done next. Asking your QAs for test scenarios, which you would be covered during implementation, would be a good idea.\n",

      "Last but not least - probably the most important thing here - make sure that you are going to solve the right problem. If you are told to get pizza then maybe baking pizza yourself is not the best solution at the moment?

Each part which I described here is equally important to make professional software. To master the development process, you need to learn a lot, take each step with the same care.

In short, CI is responsible for building, testing, and merging our application to one shared source between developers.

      "### What does it mean for developers?\n",
      "\n",
      "That means you have to sacrifice a few hours (realistically even more) at the start of the project to set up the process, and then you don’t have to worry about the process of releasing a new version of the application. Whenever someone needs the newest version, it is ready to be tested with recently added features. And the best thing is that you only have to merge the newest changes to the main branch (to be honest, you even don’t have to do that, a simple push to your own branch is sometimes sufficient).\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to achieve that?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going to show an example of CI/CD pipeline with the use of GitHub’s actions - GitHub tool for configuring CI/CD. The first point is that most of the work is done using GitHub’s servers in the cloud and doesn't require local machine setup. To configure what should be done, we have to create a workflow. To some extent, we are able to configure that using UI on GitHub under Actions tab in our repository page:\n",

      "But in this article, I am going to focus on setting CI/CD manually, writing configuration files. All of these must be placed in the .github/workflows/ directory at the root of your project. One file equals one workflow and each of them is independent.\n",

      "### Introduction and simple usage of GitHub Action\n",
      "\n",
      "So let’s begin with a straightforward example.\n",

      "Configuration files are simple YAML files.\n",
      "\n",
      "- name - just a name for a workflow, describing it in a few words. It is also visible on GitHub in the Actions tab.\n",
      "- on - it is responsible for triggering workflow. So, we are able to define a specific UTC time when it should trigger. In our case, we defined the workflow that fires every day at 1:30 am. That’s the POSIX cron syntax = “Minute Hour DayOfTheMonth MothOfTheYear DayOfTheWeek”. We are also able to define what event should occur (e.g. push/pull/commit to a specific branch) to fire that workflow.\n",

      "Finally, the jobs are the core of the workflow, they define the appropriate actions, which should be done in a workflow. Workflows can have multiple jobs, which can be run simultaneously or sequentially (e.g. one job depends on another one). Each job is executed on its own virtual machine called the runner. GitHub Actions offers virtual machines with Linux, Windows, and macOS. As you can see on the provided YAML example, by using the runs-on keyword we are able to specify what type of virtual machine we need in the following job (here you can find all types provided by GitHub). Each job consists of one or more steps, which are always executed in order and are dependent on each other. Steps from a single runner can share data between them. The step can be our own script where we need to specify behavior, or we can use predefined scripts called GitHub Actions (note that CI is also called Github Actions 🙃).

      "Back to our example, we have a single job with a singular step named “My first step”. The name keyword is not required. The step uses Close Stale Issues GitHub Action, which is helpful in closing PRs (Pull Requests), or issues in our repository, which are old enough and won’t be useful in the near future. As we can see, in order to use specific GitHub Action, we have to add the uses keyword and a reference to specific GitHub Action, in that case, it’s actions/stale@v4. If we want to specify some parameters for the chosen action, we have to use the with keyword and then provide key/value pairs, which should be described in the documentation of the action. I am not going to describe specific keywords used in that step by that action, because it’s quite self-explanatory, but if you are more interested in that I recommend reading the documentation🙂\n",

You have to remember that types of virtual machines vary in price. For example, 1 minute of work on a macOS machine equals 10 minutes of Linux.

In such situations, the matrix keyword is something you need. The idea is very simple, we are able to define some variables, assign them a few values and the runner will run the job as many times as many combinations of variables exist. In our case, we have just one variable named os with two values [ubuntu-latest, macos-11]. So the runner will execute the same code twice, but with different values assigned to the os variable.\n",

Moreover, striving for perfect code in this specific case did not make sense because the product was only an experiment that needed to be validated in the upcoming months.

      "\n",
      "I started a one-on-one conversation with Tom to ask why he thought a given change should be made and what value the change brought to the product. Mostly, I heard that the code would be \"cleaner\", which is a very subjective metric. Tom also shared why a given change might be better, giving examples from such books as \"Clean Code\" by Robert C. Martin, which is, by the way, a great book about coding. However, these books that focus on improving coding skills only talk about tools and not what we should do to deliver business needs. Books about coding skills don’t provide guidance on which solution to choose in specific business situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I attempted to distill the benefits of the proposed \"better code\" in terms of meeting business needs. I asked Tom several clarifying questions, such as:\n",

      "- Me: \"Why do you think it is worth changing this?\" Tom: \"Because it will improve the code.\"\n",
      "- Me: \"Why do you think the proposed solution is better for the business?\" Tom: \"Because it would be easier to maintain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In some circumstances, the answer \"it would be easier to maintain\" could be reasonable. However, it does not make sense for a four-month experiment that may be scrapped after validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I even asked Tom, \"When do you stop improving your code?\" and he answered, \"When neither I nor my reviewers can see any potential improvements to be made.\".\n",

      "At first, I had a humorous thought: \"You don't want me to find potential improvements in your code, because I'll comment on every line and make suggestions that will take weeks to implement. And once you've finished implementing them, I'll find even more potential improvements.\" Of course, I didn't share this joke. After chatting with Tom for a while, I realized that he was committed to Software Craftsmanship and striving for perfection. I suggested that not all of his suggestions needed to be implemented, and why it was so.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although explaining things during 1-on-1 sessions helped a little, it wasn't enough. Tom was a skilled coder and could be valuable for the team, but I needed to invest more in helping him understand that coding wasn't the only important aspect of software engineering. Our goal is to have great engineers, not just good coders. At Appunite, we challenge our engineers to be aware of the business impact of their work. To that end, I prepared a document with advice to help Tom understand the business aspect of code reviews. This approach also helped to some extent.\n",

      "### Step #3\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step was to meet as a team and discuss the issue of everyone not  being on the same page when it comes to performing a great Code Review. I shared the document that I prepared for Tom with advice for the rest of the team, so we could have a base for discussion. Based on this document, we identified what needed to be fixed and what was excessive in our Code Review process. During the meeting, we prepared a document of Team Agreements on how to approach the Code Review process and what values should be taken into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid causing arguments among employees, I refrained everyone from blaming anyone personally. Instead, I focused on identifying the team's problems and finding solutions. Our Appunite value is \"Be a team player. We succeed and fail as a team\".\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step #4\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the actions taken helped the person become a better software engineer. I also spoke with his leader about setting personal goals to help him improve on a daily basis.\n",

      "\n",
      "Why is QA important? We have already discussed it briefly, but in case you would like to mull over this topic, here you are.\n",

      "As you are already aware, bugs appear at every stage of the development process. If they are not detected and removed on time, they can cumulate and cause severe consequences to the entire software. This is why QA in software development should be treated as one of the top priorities and integrated at the early stage of the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the benefits of QA in software development? Well-implemented Software Quality Assurance positively influences aspects such as app performance, extensibility, usability and security. To provide you with more details, let’s name but a few of them:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Saving time\n",
      "\n",
      "The rule is pretty simple: the sooner you will detect bugs, the faster you will be able to remove them. This is why it’s so important to integrate Quality Assurance at every stage of the software development process.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Saving money\n",
      "\n",
      "***** 87 *****\n",

      "#### Saving money\n",
      "\n",
      "Analogically, early detected bugs are much cheaper to remove. Moreover, early error detection will mitigate the risk of rebuilding the software after errors cumulate and will make it impossible to continue development.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Increased confidence\n",
      "\n",
      "The compliance with software requirements is undoubtedly a relief and the security that the product will deliver value to both founders as well as to  users brings a huge comfort to the entire software development team.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Great product quality\n",
      "\n",
      "To put it simply, Quality Assurance leads to developing a stable, reliable product meeting market and industry standards and working as intended. With such an asset, you will be able to satisfy customers and build competitive advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Scalability\n",
      "\n",
      "***** 88 *****\n",

      "#### Scalability\n",
      "\n",
      "A well-optimized, bug-free app will be much easier to scale. Once you don’t have to deal with errors and technical failures, you will be able to head in the right strategic direction, focus on reaching a bigger audience and develop new functionalities important to your users.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Reputation boost\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, the bugged app can immediately decrease customer satisfaction and ruin your reputation as a software provider. Then, never stop your Quality Assurance in the software life cycle. A well-optimized, bug-free, attractive app will help you gain users’ interest and build your market position.\n",

      "\n",
      "As we said at the beginning of the article, testers, as a part of an agile team, will be present at every stage of the software development process. The thing is, that the sooner we find a bug, the less expensive it will be. Let’s imagine that we skipped some scenario in our requirements, or there's a logic gap. QA will be there to point it out before we’ll start working on it. In other cases, this bug can be found after release and cause some issues for final users, or just (in a better scenario) take more time to discover this issue and money to change some part of the code that has already been done and fix it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we already know that this process helps to save time and money, let’s look at a few examples that prove this thesis.\n",

      "- In 1998, NASA lost the Mars orbiter due to a trivial software error caused by the inaccuracy of metrics. The orbiter’s software sent all the data in metric units, while it was later on processed in imperial units. It generated a loss of 125 million USD.\n",
      "- In 1988, the Morris Worm led to a crash of several computers. The infected software designed to detect vulnerabilities in security systems was copied in an uncontrolled way and overloaded the processors. The final result was the damage of 6000 devices and a loss of 100 million USD.\n",
      "- In March 2008, due to inefficient testing of Heathrow’s Terminal 5 software, the system failed. As a result, thousands of pieces of luggage remained at the terminal after the flights left, and over 500 flights within 10 days got canceled. The cost of the error amounted to 50 million USD.\n",

      "- In January 1990, customers of AT&T company reported that they couldn’t place long-distance calls. The reason for that was a software bug that caused switches every time a client tried to make a call. The overall cost for the company was around 60 million USD.\n",

      "As you can clearly see, the impact of software mistakes on costs can be significant. This means that Quality Assurance is not only about fixing bugs, but a strategic investment that will surely pay off in the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "If you wish your software to be not only bug-free but reliable, reputable and scalable, it’s a must to integrate QA in the software development process. And the sooner you will do it, the better - preventing bugs and searching for the most efficient ways for software development at the earliest stages of the process are simply invaluable.\n",

The Agile Manifesto sets the foundations for how we approach new projects and challenges. The most important element of the manifesto is its conclusion: “That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.” Yes, we appreciate having detailed project documentation with a very specific and clear execution plan, wrapped into a set of fixed processes and tools, secured by a precise contract. Indeed, that can sometimes work, but are you – as our client – certain that you covered everything in that documentation? Are you certain that none of your requirements will ever change? This is why the agile approach is so important: by valuing communication, collaboration and iterative workflows, it enables us to deliver products that work better and are more closely aligned with your goals.
